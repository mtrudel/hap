defmodule HAP.CharacteristicDefinition do
  @moduledoc """
  A behaviour which encapsulates the functinos required to define a characteristic. 
  At runtime, characteristics are modeled via the `HAP.Characteristic` struct which
  contains the runtime values for the characteristic itself, as well as metadata about
  the characteristic. A `HAP.CharacteristicDefinition` is used to provide the template
  values for these fields. HAP contains definitions for many common HomeKit characteristics
  already, and users may define other characteristics by providing an implementation of
  this behaviour as the first value in the characteristic definition tuple in a service.
